Please, if you decide to run this experiment, LISTEN TO STATIC during the trial. It helps keep everything consistent. Also USE FULL SCREEN. 

Python Libraries Used:
Random - Random number generation using the secure random
Math - I actually don't know if it's used anywhere, but it's built into python so it doesn't matter too much
Os - file handling and command line clearing
Time - timing
Datetime - File name creation to get year and time
Pandas - CSV Handling
